Welcome to my ReadMe, My name is Sean and the main thing about me is I love video games.

Im currently studying at Abertay university on a Computer games technology course.
I have previously studied a HND in computer game development at Dundee and Angus college.

I have learned Java, some C# and am currently learning C++. 
I have also done some work with Maya and Aseprite.

I love to learn new techniques to develope video games, learn about new software and languages.

One great thing about me is I am not afraid to try new things to develop my skills in all areas of video game development.

In my free time, I really enjoy the board game society I go to everythursday and I love to play games with friends online.
Meeting people and talking about games inspires me to learn and create games.

This is my first real look into Github and I hope to post more projects on here in the future.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me, I hope, I have made a good impression.
If you would like to be friends or work on a project together feel free to add me on discord. 
(My ID is 'dashpotato' because dash mechanics are super fun!)
